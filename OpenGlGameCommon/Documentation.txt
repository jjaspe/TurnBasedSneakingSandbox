This library will serve as a starting point for OpenGl prototype projects. 

Base classes
 - OpenGlMap: this is your basic grid map, you might want to inherit from it and give it some more 
	specific functions, but as of now it can perform pathfinding and raytracing, and simple field of 
	view calculations.
	 It also implements IWorld so this will be the object that owns all things that can be drawn, 
	 using its Drawables property. The tiles in the grid will by in property MyTiles. 

	 Use: To build one just give it a width,length,size for the tiles, point of origin(bottom-left corner),
	 and orientation (defaults to perpendicular to Z axis). To add things to draw just create IDrawables and
	 add them to Drawables property, then call draw on the whole list.

 - DrawableGuard: Basic character unit, but it can also be drawn. Its Character property holds character data
 and it's behavior properties are used to tell it how to do things.

 - DrawablePC: Similar to DrawableGuard, but in the future it might see some changes. As of now PC can crouch
 but guards cant.

 -valuePoint: Class with an IPoint with a value attached to it. Used in DistanceMap,NoiseMaps, etc.
 
 -PatrolPath: Class used to hold a list of points that a DrawableGuard will follow. Extends OpenGlPath
