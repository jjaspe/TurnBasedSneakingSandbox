FIXED
-First guard doens't go not visible when a second is selected
	- Visible attribute inside drawables not being set to false
	Solution: SneakingGuard was hiding guardIds from DrawableGuard, which werent being assigned,
	 so ids read from Drawables were incorrect.









DONE
- Save map with guards
	- Add orientation and color to guard files, load them and save them --DONE and TESTED
