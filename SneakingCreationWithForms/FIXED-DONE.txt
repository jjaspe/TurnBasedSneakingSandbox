FIXED
-First guard doens't go not visible when a second is selected
	- Visible attribute inside drawables not being set to false
	Solution: SneakingGuard was hiding guardIds from DrawableGuard, which werent being assigned,
	 so ids read from Drawables were incorrect.

- Update loop inside update() in CreatePatrolForm when changing SelectedItem in guard list
	- Fixed: Moved actual selection actions to presenter, so selectGuard in form only calls appropriate
	Presenter methods, but doesn't change anything. 









DONE
- Move Player creation logic out of player form into Presenter (DONE)
- Finish Patrol Form View and Presenter parts
- Save map with guards
	- Add orientation and color to guard files, load them and save them --DONE and TESTED
